# Ticked

A clean and minimal task management mobile application built with React Native and Expo.

## Features

- Create tasks with a name, time and day (today or tomorrow)
- Mark tasks as completed (only available for today's tasks)
- Hide/show completed tasks
- Delete tasks
- Local notifications as reminders at the scheduled time
- Persistent storage — tasks survive app restarts
- Expired tasks (past days) are automatically removed on launch
- Onboarding screen on first launch
- Dark/light mode — follows OS setting by default, toggleable at runtime
- English/Spanish language support — follows OS locale by default, toggleable at runtime

## Data model

Each task is stored as a JSON object in AsyncStorage under the key `"Todos"`:

```json
{
  "id": "1715700000000",
  "text": "Buy groceries",
  "hour": "2024-05-14T15:00:00.000Z",
  "isToday": true,
  "isCompleted": false,
  "notificationId": "abc123"
}
```

| Field            | Type    | Description                                          |
| ---------------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `id`             | string  | `Date.now()` at creation time — unique per task      |
| `text`           | string  | Task name                                            |
| `hour`           | string  | ISO 8601 datetime string                             |
| `isToday`        | boolean | Whether the task was scheduled for today             |
| `isCompleted`    | boolean | Completion state                                     |
| `notificationId` | string? | Expo notification ID, present only when alert is set |

## Build

The app is distributed as a standalone APK via [EAS Build](https://docs.expo.dev/build/introduction/) (profile: `preview`). Each build increments `versionCode` in `app.json`. Run with:

```bash
eas build --platform android --profile preview
```

## Architecture notes

- **Persistence via thunks** — all AsyncStorage reads and writes live in `todosSlice.js` as `createAsyncThunk` actions. Components only dispatch thunks and never touch AsyncStorage directly.
- **`hideCompleted` as a flag** — completed tasks are filtered in the view layer, not removed from the store, so they can be shown again without reloading from disk.
- **Notification lifecycle** — when a task with an alert is deleted, its scheduled notification is cancelled via `Notifications.cancelScheduledNotificationAsync`.
- **Theme system** — `ThemeProvider` reads the OS color scheme via `useColorScheme()` on first launch (`userInterfaceStyle: "automatic"` in `app.json`). User preference is persisted under `@ThemePreference` and overrides the OS default.
- **i18n system** — `LanguageProvider` reads the device locale via `expo-localization` on first launch, defaulting to Spanish if the locale is `es`, English otherwise. User preference is persisted under `@LanguagePreference`. Both `i18next` and `moment.js` locale are updated on change.
